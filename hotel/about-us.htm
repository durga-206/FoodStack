        Welcome to Ham Hotel, where hospitality is more than a service — it’s
        our purpose. Established in 2004, we began with a simple dream: to
        create a place where great food, genuine care, and memorable moments
        come together. From our very first day, Ham Hotel has proudly served
        both vegetarian and non-vegetarian delicacies, prepared with a perfect
        blend of tradition and innovation. Every dish is crafted with passion,
        ensuring that each bite reflects our promise of quality and
        authenticity.
